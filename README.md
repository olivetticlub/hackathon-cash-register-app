Basic example of a checkout application using the Olivetti Cash Register 4.0 platform. 

This is a modified version of the example provided by the Olivetti dev team.

We simplified the checkout process to fit our needs and most importantly to send the signal to the Olivetti Club Merchant Halp (https://github.com/olivetticlub/olivetti-club-merchant-app) that the payment is completed and a coupon can be generated
